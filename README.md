## What Is DDOS On Syn Flood Attack?
Ok i will share a article on **pythoncode**. A SYN flood attack is a common form of a denial of service attack in which an attacker sends a sequence of SYN requests to the target system (can be a router, firewall, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), etc.) in order to consume its resources, preventing legitimate clients to establish a normal connection.
TCP SYN flood exploits the first part of the TCP three-way handshake, and since every connection using the TCP protocol requires it, this attack proves to be dangerous and can take down several network components.
In order to understand SYN flood, we first need to talk about TCP three-way handshake:
